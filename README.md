# Introduction to Verification – Summary

**Introduction to Verification** is a foundational course that focuses on the verification stage of digital systems design. The course highlights the critical role of verification in ensuring the functionality, reliability, and correctness of hardware before it reaches physical implementation and end users.

## Why Verification Matters

Verification is essential to prevent design errors that can lead to costly failures. Historical cases, such as the Mars Climate Orbiter and the Intel Pentium FDIV bug, show how small mistakes can result in financial loss, reputational damage, and even mission failure. These examples emphasize the importance of verifying every aspect of a system early and thoroughly.

## Course Purpose

The course aims to prepare students to understand and apply verification methods and tools in hardware design. It introduces the steps of the verification process, types of verification, and the use of SystemVerilog as a standard verification language.

## Key Topics Covered

- The role of verification in digital system design
- Methods and strategies for effective verification
- Common industry tools and languages (SystemVerilog)
- How to plan and execute a complete verification flow
- Hands-on practice with professional software tools

## Final Objective

To train students to identify, plan, and carry out the verification of digital systems, ensuring high-quality, low-risk designs ready for manufacturing or deployment.
